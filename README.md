# Godot Geo Clipmap

*This is not under active development and is provided as is.*

Originally built as the terrain for an MMO however limitations led me to explore other avenues.

This is a port of the implementation done by Mike in C++: https://mikejsavage.co.uk/blog/geometry-clipmaps.html

I have a short video of it in action: https://youtu.be/s0VYPWesIUg
